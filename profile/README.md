## Rationale
#### Problem Statement:
How can we get employers to be open and hire women who have less social mobility and may not have access to livelihood opportunities?

We have identified two critical problems and provided proposed solutions below. Firstly the women themselves need to be more empowered to apply for open job opportunities. However, "Masculine worded job descriptions significantly deterred women from applying to those jobs regardless of whether the job was stereotypically male, female, or gender-neutral." Therefore, our application **NeutralizeIt** attempts to resolve this issue by replacing commonly used gendered words in job advertisements with neutral ones. 

Secondly, employers need to conduct "blind interviews" so that they are not affected by unconscious bias that could affect their hiring process. The telegram bot **AnonymizeIt** addresses this issue by allowing two parties to communicate completely anonymously and privately.
